Invictrix
------------------

Getting Started
------------------

To get started with building Invictrix, you'll need to get familiar with Git and Repo.

Initialize Source (Assuming you have a valid build environment setup):

        mkdir invictrix (or whatever you want to name the source folder)

        cd ~/invictrix
        repo init -u https://github.com/InvictrixROM/manifest.git -b inv-9.0

Sync Source:

        repo sync -c -f -jx --force-sync --no-clone-bundle --no-tags (x being however many cpu jobs, you can also use -c to sync only the current branch specified by repo init)

Build Source:

        . build/envsetup.sh
        lunch invictrix_device-userdebug
        mka clean
        mka bacon

Submitting Patches
------------------

We're open source, and patches are always welcome!
To do this, you will need an account setup with our gerrit server and a changeid hooks.
To add the changeid hook in a project, use the following commands:

	cd <project>
	scp -p -P 29418 <username>@review.invictrixrom.com:hooks/commit-msg ${gitdir}/hooks/

You can also install the hook globally in all local projects

	repo forall -c 'gitdir=$(git rev-parse --git-dir); scp -p -P 29418 <username>@review.invictrixrom.com:hooks/commit-msg ${gitdir}/hooks/'

You can send patches by using these commands:

    cd <project>
    git add --all
    git commit
    git push ssh://<username>@review.invictrixrom.com:29418/<project> HEAD:refs/for/<branch>

This will commit your changes into a single commit.
Make sure your git has the changeid hooks added.
If you are going to make extra additions, just repeat steps, but instead of

	git commit

use

	git commit --amend

Gerrit will recognize it as a new patchset.
